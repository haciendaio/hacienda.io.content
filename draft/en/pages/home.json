Their corporate website, thoughtworks.com, is a medium sized website with 200k monthly views and lots of the content on the website: client stories, news, events, profiles, and more are all back-ended by Hacienda. A very long while back the website was built using Drupal. This had lots of drawbacks, from difficulty to test, to clunky user experience for editors. The revamp of the website enabled the team to experiment in building an alternative to big CMSs like Drupal. Hacienda is part of the system that was born as a result."}
